Perfect, Reza — here's a clear roadmap for the next phase of your platform development, building on everything you've accomplished so far:

---

## 🧱 Current Foundation

You've already built:
- ✅ **Backend** with modular NestJS architecture
- ✅ **Frontend** with React and modular panels (ChatPanel, OrderPanel, TimelinePanel)
- ✅ **Database** with PostgreSQL and TypeORM
- ✅ **Timeline logging** and PDF export
- ✅ **Supervisor dashboard** with filtering

Now we move into the next three major milestones:

---

## 🧊 Phase 1: Add 3D Patient Room

### 🔧 Stack Recommendation
- **Three.js** for rendering
- **React Three Fiber** for React integration
- **Drei** for UI helpers and camera controls

### 🧩 Key Components
- `PatientRoomScene`: renders the room, bed, monitor, patient model
- `VitalsMonitor`: overlays vitals data from backend
- `InteractionLayer`: clickable zones for orders, assessments

### 🧠 Backend Integration
- Serve 3D asset metadata (e.g. model paths, state)
- Sync scenario state with visual cues (e.g. cyanosis, movement)

Let me know if you want a scaffolded `PatientRoomScene.tsx` to start.

---

## 🧠 Phase 2: Extract Commands from Chat (Ollama)

### 🔍 Goal
Parse user chat into structured commands like:
```json
{ "type": "order", "target": "CBC", "urgency": "stat" }
```

### 🧠 Strategy
- Use Ollama to run a local LLM (e.g. Mistral or LLaMA2)
- Define prompt templates for command extraction
- Add a `CommandParserService` in NestJS
- Log parsed commands to timeline and trigger backend actions

Let me know if you want help designing the prompt format or wiring up Ollama.

---

## 🎨 Phase 3: Scenario Designer

### 🧩 Features
- Drag-and-drop timeline editor
- Define triggers, vitals, labs, chat responses
- Save/load scenarios from PostgreSQL
- Preview in 3D room

### 🔧 Stack
- React + Zustand or Redux for state
- Backend: `ScenarioDesignerModule` with validation and persistence
- Optional: JSON schema for scenario format

Would you like to start with a wireframe or data model for the designer?

---

Let me know which phase you want to dive into first — I can scaffold the 3D scene, wire up Ollama, or start the scenario designer UI.
